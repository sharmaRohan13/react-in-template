## POC for Rendering React in a Template

This project has been taken up as a POC for for having rendered some Markup in React and over specific elements of that markup we want to render a react component, the component inside have an individual state and should responsd to click and hover events.

We have used React Portals to render the component over the desired elements which are positioned using Bounding Rect parameters.
